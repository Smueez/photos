# photos

A Flutter project showing images from pexel free public API.

## Getting Started

- API key is 'https://api.pexels.com/v1/curated?page=1&per_page=28'
- Also added some features like, bookmarks, download photos, share photos and view in browsers.
- I have used th medium quality photo to show. Otherwise the original photos are to large to download and it takes lots of time to cache them as well.
